## 1023. Camelcase Matching
A query word matches a given pattern if we can insert **lowercase** letters to the pattern word so that it equals the query. (We may insert each character at any position, and may insert 0 characters.)

Given a list of queries, and a pattern, return an answer list of booleans, where answer[i] is true if and only if queries[i] matches the pattern.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FB"
Output: [true,false,true,true,false]
Explanation: 
"FooBar" can be generated like this "F" + "oo" + "B" + "ar".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "F" + "oot" + "B" + "all".
"FrameBuffer" can be generated like this "F" + "rame" + "B" + "uffer".
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FoBa"
Output: [true,false,true,false,false]
Explanation: 
"FooBar" can be generated like this "Fo" + "o" + "Ba" + "r".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "Fo" + "ot" + "Ba" + "ll".
```
