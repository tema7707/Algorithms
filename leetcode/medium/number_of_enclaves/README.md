## 1020. Number of Enclaves
Given a 2D array A, each cell is 0 (representing sea) or 1 (representing land)

A move consists of walking from one land square 4-directionally to another land square, or off the boundary of the grid.

Return the number of land squares in the grid for which we **cannot** walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that isn't enclosed because its on the boundary.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.
```
