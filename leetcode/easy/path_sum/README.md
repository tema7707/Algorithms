## 112. Path Sum
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.


#### Example 1:

```
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
```
