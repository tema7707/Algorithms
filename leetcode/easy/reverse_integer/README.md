## 7. Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Note**:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


#### Example 1:

```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```
